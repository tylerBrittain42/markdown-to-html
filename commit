MASS RESTRUCTURE due to single line parsing not being viable

Restructured main loop to keep track of past block element
and use past element to determine when to use outer tags are
needed(ol and ul). Logic primarily implemented in "if newEle"
portin of code.

Also write unit tests for SplitLine, InnerText, OpenTag,
and CloseTag. Shift completed functions into temp.go
for time being.
